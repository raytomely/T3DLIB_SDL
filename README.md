## What is this ? :
- This is T3DLIB port to SDL, T3DLIB is a 3D software renderer from the book: 
  "Tricks of the 3D Game Programming Gurus" written by the legendary André LaMothe.
  if you were always curious and wondered how to build a 3D software renderer from scratch this is the book to read.

- I did  my best to ditch out all Windows and DirectX stuff, and make a full port to SDL cross platform library.

## Why you should use a 3D sofware renderer ? :
- If you want total control and freedom.

- if you are bored with hardware API (OpenGL, Direct3D), and want to
  learn how evertthing works behind the scene.

- if you work with systems where there is no support for hardware accelerated 3D (i.e: no OpenGL or Direct3D).

- and finaly read this:

## Why you should use T3DLIB ? :
- if you want to use a 3D software renderer, what better than one with a 
  full book that teach you how it works from the ground up.
