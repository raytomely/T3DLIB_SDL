## What is this ?:
- This is T3DLIB port to SDL, T3DLIB is a 3D software renderer from the book: 
  "Tricks of the 3D Game Programming Gurus" written by the legendary André LaMothe.
  if you were always curious and wondered how to build a 3D software renderer from scratch this is the book to read.

- I did  my best to ditch out all Windows and DirectX stuff, and make a full port to SDL cross platform library.
