==============

- This is T3DLIB port to SDL, T3DLIB is a 3D software renderer from the book: 
  "Tricks of the 3D Game Programming Gurus" written by the legendary Andr√© LaMothe.
  if you were always curious and wondered how to build a 3D software renderer from scratch this is the book to read.

- I did  my best to ditch out all Windows and DirectX stuff, and make a full port to SDL cross platform library.

Why you should use a 3D sofware renderer ?:
==========================================

- If you want total control and freedom.

- if you are bored with hardware API (OpenGL, Direct3D), and want to
  learn how evertthing works behind the scene.

- if you work with systems where there is no support for hardware accelerated 3D (i.e: no OpenGL or Direct3D).

Why you should use T3DLIB ?:

  full book that teach you how it works from the ground up.
